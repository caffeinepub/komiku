  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-18 comprehensively. ChapterGrabbingPage.tsx is refactored to use frontend-only fetching via allorigins.win (primary) and corsproxy.io (fallback), with HTML parsing via a new htmlParser.ts utility, a draggable/removable image preview grid, and the existing createChapter backend mutation for saving. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
