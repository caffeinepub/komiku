  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for all three requirements. AdminLayout.tsx uses actorReady and isFetched from useIsCallerAdmin to handle race conditions, disable the Claim Admin button while actor is initializing, show friendly error messages, and properly render admin panel content. useQueries.ts exposes actorReady flags from useIsCallerAdmin and useClaimAdmin. All three REQs appear to be addressed.",

      "reason": "These files contain changes such as Tailwind class renaming, chapter reader UI redesign, and chapter grabbing frontend-only proxy logic that were not requested in the build request, which only asked for fixing actor availability and admin panel rendering issues.",
